# Why and What
I mainly did this to supplement my knowledge because my university is not that good (they don't even give programming assignments!). I also have to do a bachelor thesis at the end of my degree and this seems like a useful way to get information about what I should do. And I started to enjoy just collecting the information. And I hope this helps some people.

This includes some of the courses I find would be useful. I don't know what you're specifically looking for or even if you want to add the extra graduate courses. But I think this would be helpful for people looking to broaden their knowledge with the graduate courses. And you can decide if the undergraduate courses are worth adding. I think even making this discussion available and add it in extra resources or something would be useful to people.
They come with lecture notes and sometimes lecture videos, sometimes programming assignments, sometimes projects and sometimes written assignments and others. They don't always have solutions to these but sometimes show examples of things like projects and programming assignments.
I will first go through the graduate courses then the prerequisites then the extra courses then others that I found that would be useful.
There was also advanced algorithms and advanced data structures but I didn't include those.
I will list what it includes but assume it has lecture notes and I'll specify if it doesn't (One doesn't).

(these are prerequisites [These are prerequisites for the prerequisites] -> [These are prerequisites for those]) + for multiple
I'll probably get lazy and just say look above pr below sometimes

OCW Scholar courses are designed specifically for OCW’s single largest audience: independent learners. These courses are substantially more complete than typical OCW courses, and include new custom-created content as well as materials repurposed from previously published courses.

## Required for Graduate Courses (Undergraduate)

**1.00 Introduction to Computers and Engineering Problem Solving** (none)
(Includes Exams, programming assignments with examples and instructor insights)

This course presents the fundamentals of object-oriented software design and development, computational methods and sensing for engineering, and scientific and managerial applications. It cover topics, including design of classes, inheritance, graphical user interfaces, numerical methods, streams, threads, sensors, and data structures. Students use Java{{< sup “®” >}} programming language to complete weekly software assignments.
How is 1.00 different from other intro programming courses offered at MIT?
1.00 is a first course in programming. It assumes no prior experience, and it focuses on the use of computation to solve problems in engineering, science and management. The audience for 1.00 is non-computer science majors. 1.00 does not focus on writing compilers or parsers or computing tools where the computer is the system; it focuses on engineering problems where the computer is part of the system, or is used to model a physical or logical system.
1.00 teaches the Java programming language, and it focuses on the design and development of object-oriented software for technical problems. 1.00 is taught in an active learning style. Lecture segments alternating with laboratory exercises are used in every class to allow students to put concepts into practice immediately; this teaching style generates questions and feedback, and allows the teaching staff and students to interact when concepts are first introduced to ensure that core ideas are understood. Like many MIT classes, 1.00 has weekly assignments, which are programs based on actual engineering, science or management applications. The weekly assignments build on the class material from the previous week, and require students to put the concepts taught in the small in-class labs into a larger program that uses multiple elements of Java together.

We’ll wrap up by teaching you some tricks of the trade that you may need for tech interviews.
We see this as a “C/C++ empowerment” course: we want you to come away understanding
why you would want to use C over another language (control over memory, probably for performance reasons),
why you would want to use C++ rather than C (objects), and
how to be useful in C and C++.
